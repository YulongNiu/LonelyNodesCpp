# Algorithm

## Preliminaries

1.  A simple undirected graph is denoted as $G(V, E)$.

2.  For a vertex $v \in V$, $\Gamma(v)$ denotes all vertices adjacent to $v$ in $G$.

## Algorithm design

The algorithm described here is used for fast maximal cliques enumeration (MCE) of undirected graphs. Most optimizations are attributed to "locally optimal vertex ordering", so we named the new algorithm as "`LOVO`".

`LOVO` is based on Bron-Kerbosch's algorithm [@bron1973algorithm] that operating three disjoint sets of vertices during the search for maximal cliques:

$X$: $x \in X$ are searched vertices. Maximal cliques that contain $\forall x \in X$ have been found.

$R$: $\forall r \in R$ links to each other.

$P$: $\forall p \in P$ links to all vertices in $R$, but $p \in P$ not necessarily links to each other.

Status $s$ is defined as a combination of $X$, $R$, and $P$.

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
s &: \{ x \in X \}, \{ r \in R \}, \{ p \in P \} \\
& X \cup R \cup P = V
\end{split}
\end{equation*}


In raw Bron-Kerbosch's algorithm:

* Step1: randomly selecting a vertex $p$ in $P$

# Unsolved problems

## Order vertices in $P$.

**Strategy 1**: choose $v \in P$ that maximizes $\Gamma(v) \cap P$, then $v$ will be move to $X$ in the next status $s$. The search number will be reduced.
